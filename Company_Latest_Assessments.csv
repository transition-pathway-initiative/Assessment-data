The carbon intensity has been (re-)calculated according to TPI methodology. The company has set targets to reduce its absolute emissions. To calculate this company’s targeted emissions intensity, TPI has assumed that: The company’s externally sold energy products grow according to the regional or global primary energy supply growth rate projected in the IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives model ‘Reference Technology’ scenario. The company’s target covers a subset of Scope 1, 2 and 3 (use of sold products) emissions. The emissions intensities of all emissions not covered by the target are assumed to remain constant from the level of the latest disclosure."
